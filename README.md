# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Predict health insurance for a person by implementing various machine learning algorithms and perform hyperparameter tuning to them.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:

Health insurance is a necessity for every individual.The insurance offered varies from company to company because the importance given to few features are different from one another.

The aim of this project is to create an understanding of the prediction of the amount required for an individual based on their health.
This is achieved by implementing various machine learning algorithms and perform hyperparameter tuning to them.
